    <!-- 
    note: FRIENDS.html is also a html site.
        when clicked, it will show contents in it.
        this way link_link.html contains another html file(FRIENDS.html) when clicked leads to another files.
    this way a link can be established from one web page to another web page and further to another web page internally.
    Example:
    As happens in wikipedia.
    when we click on a blue coloured word it creates another tab having info about it and when clicked a blue word in the new tab it further creates another tab and thus it goes on and on.
